# My Social Media Data Analysis

I am a Harvard-trained senior data scientist with a Ph.D. in Economics and over a decade of experience focusing on data-driven strategy and decision-making. 
Aside from my professional life, I am passionate about examining human day-to-day life through a data-driven and factual lens in social media, particularly socio-economic and development trends. My Twitter/X account includes a combination of Persian, English, and Turkish examples of my approach.

I am dedicated to sharing my knowledge and experience with economic students and junior data scientists. I recently learned that sharing my fast—sometimes untidy—codes and data would benefit them. But I need more time to make them interactive and beautiful pages, and I have to move everything gradually. This is 6 years of work only from my Twitter activities and in three different languages: Python, R, and STATA! So, be patient with me. Your support and patience are greatly appreciated. 

In my job, I combine causal inference, statistical analysis, ML, and behavioral economics to deliver data-driven solutions and solve complex problems. In social and traditional media, I am more focused on communicating factual descriptions of socio-economic issues using descriptive statistics, visualization, and game theory. 

Also, I donate my time to philanthropic projects in impact investment, empowering NGOs and donors to create sustainable impacts in microfinance, service delivery, and education.


## Data

The data in this repo is usually collected through API connections from public sources or direct downloads. I will include the necessary codes so you can recreate them.
Some data are created using web search, which is small; for now, they will stay in the data folder in this repo.
Also, I love NLP and crawling the web to create new datasets.

## Code

In this folder, I provide the code used for nalysis, including any libraries and tools used, as well as the actual code snippets. I am a Python - SQL person, but not married to them! for some porpuses I use STATA, R, and in rare occasion SAS. The required packages will be included in the codes, so don't worry!
